            <p>I'm from Pakistan, and I am deeply passionate about making a positive impact in my community. I have actively contributed to several causes, starting with my volunteer work at Dar-ul-Sukun. There, I organized events and taught basic subjects to special needs children, which reinforced my commitment to educational support. Additionally, my experience at the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation involved assisting medical practitioners and understanding the crucial role of support and efficiency in critical care environments. These experiences have underscored the importance of leveraging my skills to support underprivileged communities and contribute to meaningful causes.</p>
